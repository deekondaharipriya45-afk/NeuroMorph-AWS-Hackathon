# NeuroMorph – Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

NeuroMorph is an AI-powered creative assistant platform designed to support Writers, Designers, and Marketers.  
It helps transform a single piece of content into multiple optimized versions tailored for different platforms, audiences, emotional tones, and regional languages.

The goal is to enhance digital content workflows by reducing repetitive tasks and improving content personalization using AI.


## 2. Problem Statement

Digital content creators spend significant time:

- Rewriting content for different platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
- Adjusting tone for different audiences (Gen Z, Corporate, Casual)
- Translating content for regional markets
- Creating marketing copies and campaign variations
- Generating creative hooks and slogans

Existing tools mostly provide generic content generation without strategic adaptation.

There is a need for an intelligent AI system that understands context, tone, audience, and cultural nuances.


## 3. Objectives

- Provide a unified AI platform for creative professionals
- Automate content transformation and personalization
